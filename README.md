# Mini Canvas: A Course Management Tool

*Given a course ID, extract details of the course.*

## 📚 Description
The goal of this project is to build a tool that is useful to instructors and students in course management. Each course is identified by a unique `course_id` and contains information about the number of `credits` the course is worth, the `instructor` of the course as well as `students` enrolled in this course.

Possible features include:
- Specifying a course to get detailed information;
- Adding a student to a certain course;
- Entering students' grades for each course;
- Visualizing student's grades in a dashboard.

The target is to be able to combine course information and student data for a **full picture** of the course and its activity. Through this project, I will discover valuable connections between CS and my previous studies in education.
