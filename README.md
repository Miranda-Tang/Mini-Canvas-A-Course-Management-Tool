# Course Details: A Learning Analytics Tool
 
*Given a courseID id, extracts details of courseID.*

## ðŸ—‚ Description

The goal of this project is to build a tool that is useful to instructors and students in courseID management. Each courseID is identified by a unique `course_id` and contains information about the number of `credits` the courseID is worth, the `instructor` of the courseID as well as `students` enrolled in this courseID. 

Possible features include: 
- Specifying a courseID to get detailed information; 
- Adding a student to a certain courseID;
- Entering students' grades of each courseID;
- Visualizing each student's grades in a dashboard.

The target is to be able to combine courseID information and student data for a **"full picture"** of the courseID and its activity. Through this project I expect to discover valuable connections between CS and my previous studies in the field of education.
