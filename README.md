# Course Details: A Learning Analytics Tool
 
*Given a course id, extracts details of course.*

## ðŸ—‚ Description

The goal of this project is to build a tool that is useful to instructors who are interested in learning analytics but may not have an institutional solution. Each course is identified by a unique `course_id` and contains information about the number of `credits` the course is worth, a list of `courses` that list this course as a direct pre-requisite, the `instructor` of the course as well as `students` enrolled in this course. 

Possible features include:
- Adding new courses into the database; 
- Specifying a course to get related information; 
- Grouping and screening courses by certain criteria; 
- Visualizing each student's progress in a dashboard.

The target is to be able to combine course information and student data for a **"full picture"** of the course and its activity. Through this project I expect to discover valuable connections between CS and my previous studies in the field of education.
