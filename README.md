# Canvas: A Learning Analytics Tool

*Given a course id, extracts details of course.*

## üìö Description

The goal of this project is to build a tool that is useful to instructors and students in course management. Each course is identified by a unique `course_id` and contains information about the number of `credits` the course is worth, the `instructor` of the course as well as `students` enrolled in this course.

Possible features include:
- Specifying a course to get detailed information;
- Adding a student to a certain course;
- Entering students' grades of each course;
- Visualizing student's grades in a dashboard.

The target is to be able to combine course information and student data for a **full picture** of the course and its activity. Through this project I expect to discover valuable connections between CS and my previous studies in the field of education.

## ü§î Phase 4: Task 3
1. [x] Move nested classes inside `CanvasApp` out and make them independent classes that extend `CanvasApp`.
2. [x] Apply `Singleton pattern` to ensure that all GUI-related classes are dealing with the same database (Canvas).
3. [x] Extract common pattern from each GUI interface and create a method to set up this template wherever needed to avoid duplication and lower semantic coupling.
4. [x] Add checked exceptions to prevent the program from crashing when there's invalid input.
